        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hi, I'm Daveson L. Narvasa a BSIT student of Golden State Colleges, with the age of 19 Years old. My birthdate is at March 27, 2004. One of my hobby is playing video games, physical activities such as Basketball, and drawing. I choose Bachelor of science in Information Technology (BSIT) it is because of society's ongoing modernization. Having a knowledge of current and advance technology is a cons of having a lot of Job Oppotunities its not that just about job but it also helps me as a college student to create most of my projects and assignments. But either im still honing my skills both hardware and software for a better feature on my future. </p>
